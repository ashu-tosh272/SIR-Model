# SIR-model
This model is basically to predit the duration of pandemic, since it is a scientific
model I have use some assumptions.
The basic assumptions are as follows:

1) The entire sample size fits into one of the following categories:
   
a) S : Susceptible
those who can potentially catch the disease.

b) I : Infectious
those who already have the disease and are potential carriers.

c) R : Removed
those who are have recovered form the disease and are now immune to 
it. This also include the people who have passed away due to the 
particular disease.

2) The samples size of people is fixed. The sample of people under study are well 
defined. A major part of this assumption is that the population growth 
rate/death rate is negligible; that is during the period of study, the population of 
the sample under consideration doesnâ€™t change by much.

3) The population is well mixed. Ideally, everyone will come in contact with 
the same fraction of people in each category every day. Again, it is not 
possible to keep a track of who a person meets every day especially when 
we have a large sample size under consideration.

4) Infected people recover or die at a constant rate.
